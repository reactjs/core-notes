# React Core Meeting Notes

React Core team meets once a week to discuss the development of React, future plans, and priorities.  
These notes are relatively new and started in March, 2016. You can find an archive of older notes [here](https://discuss.reactjs.org/c/meeting-notes).

New notes will be added as pull requests so you will be notified of them if you watch the repo.  
You can comment on the pull requests to discuss the notes, or raise issues if you would like to ask for a clarification.

The repo format is inspired by [Ember Core Notes](https://github.com/emberjs/core-notes).
